Let\u2019s start with Virtual Machines in simple words. The purpose of a virtual machine is to virtualize the version of a host computer or server (like client APIs) and deploy that version on multiple (end-user) systems across the world with the help of software programs and automation. In Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, the software programs are typically installed and maintained by developers in centralized institutions for proprietary use."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now let\u2019s bring the Ethereum network into the mix. With EVM in Web 3.0, open-source blockchain is used to handle the virtualization of servers across multiple systems with the help of network protocols. The technology is primarily operated and maintained by unrelated nodes on the network resulting in high decentralization. Moreover, EVM was further developed to perform and execute any logical step of a computational function through its \u2018smart contract\u2019 with a level of automation that was never seen before."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We now have a state machine that virtualizes servers and interfaces of thousands of applications across multiple systems with an unbelievable level of automation.
