It supports blended execution of different VM targets on a shared state execution environment for real-time composability between apps from different ecosystems. The network is both EVM and SVM-compatible, maintaining ABI encodings for all contracts, and introducing no additional overhead for deploying apps in Solidity, Vyper, or Solana Rust.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Knowledge Base/The Fluent VM":{"id":"Knowledge Base/The Fluent VM","title":"The Fluent VM","description":"The Fluent VM is a minimally modified version of the WebAssembly (Wasm) binary instruction format designed for verifiable applications. It is a reduced version of Wasm, called rWasm, which maintains compatibility with the original Wasm instruction set yet is optimized for zero-knowledge (zk) operations. Sections of the instruction set are embedded inside the binary, enhancing the efficiency and ease of verification of Wasm programs in a zk-rollup.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Knowledge Base/The Fluentbase Framework":{"id":"Knowledge Base/The Fluentbase Framework","title":"The Fluentbase Framework","description":"The Fluentbase framework is used to deploy smart contracts on the Fluent L2 as well as blockchains and verifiable compute environments that compile to rWasm.
