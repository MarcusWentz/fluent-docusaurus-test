  "description": "Sharding is a network architecture that enables parallel processing to achieve increased transaction throughput and greater performance. It involves breaking the network into smaller, more manageable pieces called \"shards.\" Each shard processes a portion of the network's transactions independently, thus allowing for parallel processing and increasing the network's overall capacity.",
